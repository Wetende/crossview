# Course Submission & Admin Vetting
*Brainstorming Summary*

---

## 1. The Submission Workflow

To ensure quality and compliance (especially for TVET/Theology deployments), instructors must submit their Programs/Courses for Admin approval before they can be Published.

### Status Lifecycle
*   **DRAFT**: Instructor is building content. Visible only to them.
*   **SUBMITTED**: Sent for review. Content is "Locked" (read-only) for the instructor during review.
*   **CHANGES_REQUESTED**: Admin has reviewed and provided feedback for fixes.
*   **APPROVED**: Course meets standards. Instructor can now toggle **Published** to make it live for students.

## 2. Admin Review Experience

### The "Reviewer" Dashboard
*   **Approval Queue**: A list of all courses in the `SUBMITTED` state.
*   **Preview as Student**: A "Deep Link" that allows the admin to view the course interface *exactly* as a student would, without needing to enroll or pay.
*   **Vetting Checklist**: (Optional) A customizable list of criteria (e.g., "Contains at least one practical assessment", "Bio is complete").

## 3. Feedback & Re-submission

### The "Change Request" Log
Instead of a simple "Reject", we use a **Feedback Loop**:
*   Admin highlights specific Lessons or Assessments that need improvement.
*   Instructor receives a notification with the list of required changes.
*   Content is "Unlocked" for editing again.

## 4. Key Questions to Discuss

1.  **Strictness**: Should *every* update to a published course require re-approval, or only the initial launch?
2.  **Auto-Vetting**: Can we use AI to run a "pre-check" for common issues (e.g., broken links, empty sessions) before the instructor hitting submit?
3.  **Permissions**: Are there "Lead Instructors" who can approve content for "Assistant Instructors", or is it always a central Admin?
