# Content Management & Assessments
*Brainstorming Summary*

---

## 1. Content Management

### What Types of Content Can Instructors Create?
*   **Text/Rich Content** – HTML editor, markdown?
*   **Video** – Upload or embed (YouTube, Vimeo)?
*   **Documents** – PDFs, slides, downloadable resources?
*   **Interactive** – H5P, SCORM packages?
*   **Live Sessions** – Zoom/Meet integration?

### Content Organization
How is content structured within a course/program?
*   **Modules → Lessons → Items** (classic LMS hierarchy)?
*   Tied to the Blueprint's hierarchy labels (e.g., "Unit → Topic → Subtopic")?
*   Drag-and-drop reordering?

### Access Control
*   **Drip Content** – Unlock lessons over time or based on progress?
*   **Prerequisites** – Must complete Lesson 1 before Lesson 2?
*   **Visibility** – Draft vs Published content?

### Assessment Types
What kinds of assessments should the system support?
*   **Quizzes** – Multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank
*   **Assignments** – File upload submissions
*   **Essays** – Long-form text responses (manually graded)
*   **Practical/Practicum** – Checklist-based skill verification
*   **Peer Review** – Students grade each other?

### Question Bank
*   Should instructors have a **Question Bank** to reuse questions across quizzes?
*   Random question selection from pool?
*   Categorize questions by topic/difficulty?

### Grading & Feedback
*   **Auto-grading** for objective questions (MCQ, T/F)?
*   **Manual grading** for essays/assignments?
*   **Rubrics** – Structured grading criteria?
*   **Feedback** – Inline comments on submissions?

### Assessment Settings
*   **Time limits** – Timed quizzes?
*   **Attempts** – Single attempt vs multiple retakes?
*   **Late submissions** – Penalty or hard cutoff?
*   **Proctoring** – Any lockdown browser integration?

## 3. Key Questions to Discuss

1.  **Content Types**: Which content types are must-have vs nice-to-have for your use case?
2.  **Assessment Priority**: Which assessment types are essential for launch?
3.  **Grading Complexity**: Do you need rubrics, or is simple points-based grading sufficient?
4.  **Question Bank**: Is question reuse important, or will each quiz be standalone?
